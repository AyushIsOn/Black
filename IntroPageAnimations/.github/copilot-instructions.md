# WebGL Stars Animation Project

This project contains an extracted stars animation system from the Bitkraft website. The goal is to maintain the exact visual appearance and functionality of the original system while making it runnable as a standalone application.

## Key Requirements:
- Preserve original aesthetics and functionality
- Maintain 65,536 stars with identical visual properties
- Keep original shader parameters and animation timing
- Minimal modifications to extracted code
- Standalone operation without external dependencies
